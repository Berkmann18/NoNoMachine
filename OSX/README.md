# NoNoMachine
## Description
A package for CLI users who needs to do stuff on NoMachine but don't want to use NoMachine (because it's crap!).

It contains the following files:
- cim.sh: Bash script made for transfering files/directories across your computer and your CIM desktop (type ./cim.sh -h to see how you could use it)
- psqlConnect.sh: Bash script made to connect the current CLI window to the uni's PostgresSQL server
- psqlRemoteConnect.sh: Same as psqlConnect.sh but for NON-SSH sessions
- setup.sh: Setup script that will setup the package
- SSH_config.txt: SSH config file that ease manual SSH connections
- sshDB.sh: Bash script made for connecting the current CLI window to the TeachDB environment.

## Setup
In order to setup the package, you need to open a CLI wi

```bash

```
## Note
This package is still not tested (due to the impossibility to get an OSX VM to work) so it __may not work__.
Also, this package is originally intended to be used by only RHUL CIM students/staff on OSX, so if you're not a CompSci/InfoSec/Maths RHUL student and don't get it work, then it's _normal_.


## TODO

- Add a client script (cf. ../Linux/client.sh)
- Have a working setup script along the other scripts too
- Complete the Setup section with the right instructions (possibly based off Linux's ones)

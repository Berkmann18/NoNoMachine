# NoNoMachine
## Description
A package for CLI users who needs to do stuff on NoMachine but don't want to use NoMachine (because it's crap!).

## Content
- [Linux](Linux/README.md)
- [Windows](Windows/README.md)
- [OSX](OSX/README.md)

## Note
This package is originally intended to be used by only RHUL CIM students/staff, so if you're not a CompSci/InfoSec/Maths RHUL student and don't get it work, then it's _normal_.
